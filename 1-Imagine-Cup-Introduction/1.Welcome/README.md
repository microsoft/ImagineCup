# A Message From the Global Imagine Cup Director

21 years ago we had a vision to create a global event where students would be given the opportunity to showcase their creativity and innovation using technology. Since that first Imagine Cup over 2 million students have participated from almost 200 countries across the globe. It is incredibly inspiring to see these student developers take their ideas from dreams to reality and then to compete with the best and the brightest for the Imagine Cup.

Imagine Cup competitors have grown up in an interconnected world of devices that react to their touch, their voice, and their imagination. Curiosity has driven them to not only understand how to use technology, but how to master it and harness it for the future. It is you, the young innovators and creators of the world that will imagine and build what’s next.

Our mission at Microsoft is to empower every person on the planet achieve more and I strongly believe that student competitors of Imagine Cup embody that mission. Whatever you accomplish here today and moving forward will have a ripple effect on the world around you. Your solutions will open our eyes and our minds and give us a glimpse into the future.

Over the past 21 years we’ve seen some incredible projects utilizing the cutting-edge of technology. From a prototype application to monitor blood glucose for Type 1 diabetes, to a non-invasive solution to measure fetal health for expectant mothers, to a mixed reality innovation that allows engineers from around the world to be holographically “teleported” into a workspace when needed—and many, many more—we have been continuously impressed by student innovation and can’t wait to see what’s next. I wish you all the best of luck!
