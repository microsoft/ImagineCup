- Topic 1: Microsoft Teams

# Introduction

When working on a team, communication and collaboration are very important. In today's virtual world, there are lots of tools that you and your team can use to work together. In this unit, we outline a few tools that you can use for team communication, work planning, and work execution & collaboration.

## Topic 1: Microsoft Teams

Successful teams communicate well. Microsoft Teams is one of many communication platforms that enables you to communicate quickly, and effectively. Let's learn a little bit more about Teams below.

### What is Microsoft Teams?

As stated on the [Microsoft Website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/welcome-to-microsoft-teams-b98d533f-118e-4bae-bf44-3df2470c2b12), Microsoft Teams is a collaboration app that helps your team stay organized and have conversationsâ€”all in one place.

In Teams, the possibilities are endless. But you have 4 primary options when it comes to using Teams to work with others. You can Chat, Meet, Call, and Collaborate. Chatting enables you to share your opinion and have fun with your team. Send GIFs, stickers, and emojis in a group chat or in one-to-one messages. Then you can meet. You can instantly go from group chat to video conference with the touch of a button. Teams of two or 10,000 can meet in one place from anywhere. On top of that, you can make and receive calls directly in Microsoft Teams with advanced features like group calling, cloud voicemail, and call transfers. And lastly, you can collaborate by easily finding, sharing, and editing files in real time using familiar apps like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel right in Microsoft Teams.

Microsoft Teams is a top-notch platform for team collaboration. But we know it's not the only platform out there. Whatever platform you choose to use for your team, make sure it's a platform that allows you to work collaboratively and effectively.

## Topic 2: GitHub

### What is GitHub?

The following definition of GitHub comes from [Kinsta.com](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/)

At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two connected principles: Version control, which helps developers track and manage changes to a software projectâ€™s code, and Git, which is a specific open-source version control system.

Learn more about GitHub in the following video from the GitHub YouTube.

GitHub has [many great features](https://github.com/features) - one we will point out as especially useful for teams is [GitHub Project Boards](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards/about-project-boards). With GitHub Project Boards you can create Kanban boards that help you and your team track which work items you haven't done yet, are currently doing, or will do in the future.

### How do you get started with GitHub?

Get started with GitHub by signing up for an account at [Github.com](https://github.com/). After you have an account, you can use the [Get Started Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) that the GitHub team has created to help you understand the platform.
