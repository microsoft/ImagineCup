## Topic 1: Your Team & Your 'Wave'

When forming a team, it's essential to first define the idea or opportunity you're pursuing. A clear idea makes it easier to select teammates with the right skills. The Garage team uses the concept of a "wave" to describe an idea’s potential. But how do you identify a wave that can propel your ideas forward?

Imagine you're a surfer. Watch the video below and adopt a surfer's mindset for your next big idea.

A "wave" represents an opportunity—a trend or event that can push your idea forward. Identifying waves is key to success:

- Look for unique events or trends in time.
- Assess if the wave is rare and impactful.
- After identifying a wave, gather people with diverse skills to help you ride it.

## Topic 2: Diving Deeper with Waves

Now that we know a wave is a metaphor for an emerging trend, let's dive deeper into how to identify these trends. What steps should you take to spot a wave? And what are some real-world examples of waves?

Waves can be sparked by many forces, including shifts in consumer behavior, government regulations, market disruptions, or new technologies. These waves create opportunities for ideas and innovation.

Here are some examples of impactful waves:

- Environmental concerns led to green tech innovations like electric cars, solar panels, and energy storage.
- GDPR regulations created accountability tools for enterprises managing personal data.
- The rise of social media spurred the development of content aggregators and scheduling tools.
- The COVID-19 pandemic generated new waves, such as contact tracing, data visualization, telemedicine, and remote work solutions.

Understanding waves will guide you as you recruit the right team to capitalize on these trends.

## Topic 3: Recruiting Your Team

As you identify waves and share your vision, you'll connect with people who are passionate about similar ideas. When building a team, diversity and shared enthusiasm are key.

Watch this video where Ed Essey shares questions to consider when recruiting the right people for your team.

When assembling your team, ask yourself:

- Does the team have a diverse skill set?
- Can the team achieve its goals?

Recruiting team members with the right skills and mindsets is crucial. Build a team culture by fostering open-mindedness, defining roles, establishing decision-making processes, and encouraging collaboration.

> 💡 **Pro-Tip:** Team-building takes time. Create an environment that promotes collaboration, role clarity, and openness to new ideas.

## The Microsoft Garage: More Information

In its early days, The Garage focused on empowering employees to integrate Microsoft's cultural priorities—such as Growth Mindset, Customer Obsession, and Diversity & Inclusion—into their daily work. As The Garage expanded, it began supporting teams and organizations in integrating these values into their workflows. Today, The Garage also involves Microsoft customers in collaborative growth mindset activities.

This lesson is based on the Garage Growth Framework (GGF), a set of methods used to foster innovation at Microsoft. These methods, applied by teams at hackathons like the Microsoft Global Hackathon, help build skills that can be transferred to day-to-day work. The GGF draws from Microsoft’s experiences, insights from industry leaders, and best practices from innovation experts.
